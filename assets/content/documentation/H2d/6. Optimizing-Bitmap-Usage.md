# Optimizing bitmaps

The following are some tips for better use of bitmaps with Heaps:

    * Use images with sizes of a power of 2 as textures (16, 32, 64, 128, 256 etc.). Graphics cards process textures much more quickly when images are sized as such.
    * For fast tile rendering, use the `h2d.TileGroup` module.
    * If you have a lot of separate bitmaps? Combine them in one texture to reduce memory usage. Software exists abundantly on the web which can pack sprites neatly into images for this purpose, including [`TexturePacker`](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker).
    * For particle rendering, use the `h2d.SpriteBatch` module.
    * Use the `engine.drawCount` function to see the draw calls. A lower value is best.
